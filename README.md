This folder contains 3 programs.
The ArrSort.cpp file Should be given the size of a vector of integers, and then provide each integer. The program should then sort the array in increasing order, and output the array after removing alternating numbers, starting with the second number.

The vowels.cpp file is a program that when given a string, will remove all of the vowels as well as the spaces, and return the string that remains.

The SubOccur.cpp file will be given 2 strings. The first string will be the larger string, and the second string will be a smaller one. The program will then search to see if there are any occurances of the smaller string in the larger one. it will then return the number of occurances.

Code can be compiled in terminal using:

g++ -o sort_array ArrSort.cpp
g++ -o vowel vowels.cpp
g++ -o occur SubOccur.cpp
